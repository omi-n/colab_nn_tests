# All notebooks made in Google Colaboratory Pro

## Convolutional_NN:
This notebook is what I used to explore fairly basic convolutional neural networks (CNN) using CIFAR-10. 
Loss function is Cross-Entropy loss, separated to log softmax and NLLLoss. 
Optimizer is Adam, although I had some decent results using SGD with momentum (0.9).
